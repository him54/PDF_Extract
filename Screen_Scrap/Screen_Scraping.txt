Maior Mohit Sharma, SM was leading Bravo Assault Team in operations in Kupwara District of
North Kashmir. A valiant warrior. he excelled in the art of fighting guerrillas in jungte terrain
having earlier spent four years in Jammu & Kashmir. On 21 March 2009, after receiving
information of presence of some infiltrating terrorists in dense Haphruda Forest, he planned
meticulously and led his commandos in tracking them. On observing suspicious movement. he
aterted his scouts but terrorists fired from three directions indiscriminately. In the heavy exchange
of fire, four commandos were wounded immediately. With complete disregard to his safety, he
crawled and recovered two soldiers to safety. Unmindful of the overwhelming fire. he threw
grenades and killed two terrorists but was shot in the chest. In the brief respite that followed. he
kept directing his commandos, in spite of serious injuries. Sensing further danger to his
comrades, he charged in a daring close quarter combat killing two more terrorists and attained
martyrdom fighting for his motherland in the finest traditions of Indian Army.
